title: Slack Enterprise at IBM
---

## In a nutshell
While on the Whitewater team in 2017, I played a significant role in making Slack available to all IBMers. We launched the Slack Enterprise Grid product on January 31, 2017 and saw adoption grow from 0 to 170K users (~77K active) within the year. I worked with senior leaders in 15 business units and 3 communities of practice to smoothly onboard their business units to Slack Enterprise Grid.

## Problem statement

## Desired outcomes

## My contributions
- Communication strategy, copywriting, and overseeing comms for the launch: https://whitewater.ibm.com/announcement/slack-enterprise
- Establishing & maintaining relationships with senior leaders in significant BUs across IBM as we onboarded their employees to Slack Enterprise Grid
- Updates to the Whitewater website, including the creation of several Slack training guides
- Designing and user testing the Slack Workspace Directory
- Developing a safe, smooth migration experience for teams on Slack Plus to move over to Slack Enterprise Grid
- Helping develop an "everyone does support" process for our team, in order to quickly address user questions & problems and improve the experience of getting support
- Close partnership & collaboration with the vendor (Slack Corp)

## Solution

## Where the project is now
The Whitewater team was reorganized and renamed [Toolbox@IBM](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/toolbox/whitewater-now-toolbox). The team's goal is still to bring the best in class tools that enable IBMers to transform and accelerate into new ways of working.
