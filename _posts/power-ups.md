title: Power Ups
---

In 4Q 2017, I led the user research, UX design, and prototyping for the Power Ups project under Daniele Hayes (VP of Systems & Tools under the CIO, Fletcher Previn). Jeff Robke was the project lead, and I was the sole designer on the project. Our mission was to quickly validate the problem that IBMers are not getting as much value and productivity from the current tools suite as they could, and then propose a potential solution. We pitched the idea that new, small automations (“power ups”) integrated with the tool suite could help IBMers do more high-value work. In December, I led an executive playback to Daniele and received a green light to turn this into a real, long-term project and build out a team to do the work! The project was a huge success and has the direct goal of making work better for IBMers.
