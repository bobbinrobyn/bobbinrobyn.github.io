## In a nutshell
In 4Q 2017, I led the user research, UX design, and prototyping for the Power Ups project within IBM CIO. Jeff Robke was the project lead, and I was the sole designer on the project. Our mission was to quickly validate the problem that IBMers are not getting as much value and productivity from the current tools suite as they could, and then propose a potential solution. We pitched the idea that new, small automations (“power ups”) integrated with the tool suite could help IBMers do more high-value work. In December, I led an executive playback to our VP and received a green light to turn this into a real, long-term project and build out a team to do the work! The project was a huge success and has the direct goal of making work better for IBMers.

## Problem statement
The vast majority of IBMers are novice tool users who do not get maximum value or productivity out of the current IBM tools suite. This leaves them stuck doing shallow tasks and fighting with their tools, instead of doing higher value work. 

## Desired outcomes
- Increase IBMer productivity, time to productivity, and engagement
- Lower the cost of coordination between people and tools
- Cultivate culture change through modeling modern tool use
- Accelerate user discovery of our tools and how to use them productively 
- Get more value out of existing tool suite

## My contributions
- [User research](https://ibm.box.com/s/bwqwof40q84x42i5kuq1qd135bfq9t2b) (8 IBMers, 5 stakeholders)
- UX design and prototyping - _see below_
- [Executive playback](https://ibm.box.com/s/zy8wu0gtgf10kcz7xadr5yz5s79jdb9y)

## Solution prototype
Automations that enhance and integrate tools and make it easier for IBMers to do higher value work.

## Where the project is now
The first power up to be built out is an [incident manager](https://pages.github.ibm.com/power-ups/incident-manager-pages/), now available to all IBMers.
