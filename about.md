Hi there! I've been a user experience designer at IBM since 2014. Some of my superpowers are design strategy, content strategy, user research, and stakeholder management. I've also got a lot of experience around developing empowered teams and healthy ways of working.

I earned a Master of Design in Communication Planning & Information Design from Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's degree in architecture.
