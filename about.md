Hi there! I have 6 years of experience as a design team lead and UX designer at IBM. Some of my superpowers are design strategy, content strategy, user research, and stakeholder management. I've also got a lot of experience around developing empowered teams and healthy ways of working.

I earned a Master of Design in Communication Planning & Information Design from Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's degree in architecture.
